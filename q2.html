  <h1>Kale Pizza Crust</h1>
  <p>Cauliflower crust has had it's time to shine. Let the curly leafed, 
  green superstar stand up. Green is typically not a color of most pizza 
  crusts, in fact, most of the time it would probably be frowned upon and symbolize old age.</p>
  <p>Introducing a new variety of 
  
  <a href="http://www.sweetashoney.co/kale-pizza-crust/"> low-carb pizza crust</a>
  that contains an insane amount of vitamins 
  and nutritious benefits, made out of kale. A crust this healthy makes me wonder why we didn't 
  stick it in pizza earlier. Load it up with all of your favorite toppings and you'll have a well balanced meal. 
  Getting your greens can be easy as pie.</p>

   health benefits. As a big fan of everything in tot form, I went on a quest to 
   find a version of tater tots that were ~all natural~. These
